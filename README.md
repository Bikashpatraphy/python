checkerboard.py requires pythtb package https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb.
Programme checkerboard.py solves a 2D checkerboard model with complex hopping
along diagonal bonds and computes band structure, chern number, flow of 
hybrid Wannier center and edge band structure. Two sets of parameters are used, 
one in the trivial phase and other in the non-trivial or topological phase.
Results are given in checkerboard.pdf file.
